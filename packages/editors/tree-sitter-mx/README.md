# @marko/tree-sitter

A [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/) grammar for the
[Marko](https://markojs.com/) templating language.

It covers the full language: both authoring modes (HTML and
concise/indentation-based), `${placeholders}`, tag variables, arguments and
parameters, shorthand `#id`/`.class` and method attributes, attribute
groups, statement tags, raw-text tags, `--` content blocks, and `$`
scriptlets, all with the exact source ranges the Marko compiler sees, so the
tree is reliable for highlighting, folding, structural editing, and tooling.

## Usage

With the node bindings:

```js
const Parser = require("tree-sitter");
const Marko = require("@marko/tree-sitter");

const parser = new Parser();
parser.setLanguage(Marko);

const tree = parser.parse("<button onClick() { count++ }>${count}</button>");
console.log(tree.rootNode.toString());
```

In the browser (or anywhere native bindings are unwanted), use the wasm
build with [web-tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/tree/master/lib/binding_web):

```js
import { Language, Parser } from "web-tree-sitter";

await Parser.init();
const Marko = await Language.load("tree-sitter-marko.wasm");
const parser = new Parser();
parser.setLanguage(Marko);
```

Building from a checkout:

```sh
npm install
npm run build        # tree-sitter generate && node-gyp rebuild
npm run build:wasm   # tree-sitter-marko.wasm (the CLI fetches wasi-sdk itself)
```

For editors, the grammar ships ready-to-use queries: `queries/highlights.scm`
for syntax highlighting captures and `queries/injections.scm` for
embedded-language injections (described below).

## Editors and tools

Every integration consumes the same artifacts: the generated parser
(`src/parser.c` + `src/scanner.c`), the queries in `queries/`, and, for
embedded highlighting, the `typescript`, `css`, and `scss` grammars installed
in the host tool like any other language.

### tree-sitter CLI

From this directory:

```sh
npx tree-sitter playground            # interactive tree in the browser
npx tree-sitter parse file.marko      # print the syntax tree
npx tree-sitter highlight file.marko  # ANSI highlighting (--html for a page)
```

`highlight` resolves the injected languages through the CLI config: run
`tree-sitter init-config`, then make sure one of the `parser-directories`
in `~/.config/tree-sitter/config.json` holds clones of
`tree-sitter-typescript` (run `npm install --ignore-scripts` inside it, as
its queries reference its `tree-sitter-javascript` dependency),
`tree-sitter-css`, and `tree-sitter-scss`. Note the loader only discovers
grammars that have a `tree-sitter.json`.

### Neovim

Neovim (0.10+) needs no plugins. Compile the parser onto the runtime path
and start treesitter for the filetype:

```sh
# from this directory
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/nvim/site/parser ~/.local/share/nvim/site/queries
npx tree-sitter build -o ~/.local/share/nvim/site/parser/marko.so
cp -R queries ~/.local/share/nvim/site/queries/marko
```

```lua
-- init.lua
vim.filetype.add({ extension = { marko = "marko" } })
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("FileType", {
  pattern = "marko",
  callback = function()
    vim.treesitter.start()
  end,
})
```

Embedded highlighting uses whatever parsers are installed; with
nvim-treesitter that's `:TSInstall typescript css scss`.

### Helix

Register the grammar and language in `~/.config/helix/languages.toml`:

```toml
[[language]]
name = "marko"
scope = "source.marko"
file-types = ["marko"]
comment-token = "//"
block-comment-tokens = { start = "<!--", end = "-->" }
injection-regex = "^marko$"

[[grammar]]
name = "marko"
source = { git = "https://github.com/marko-js/tree-sitter", rev = "<commit>" }
```

(or `source = { path = "/path/to/tree-sitter" }` for a local
checkout), then:

```sh
hx --grammar fetch && hx --grammar build
```

and copy the queries to `~/.config/helix/runtime/queries/marko/`.

### Zed

Marko support in Zed is provided by the
[marko-js/zed](https://github.com/marko-js/zed) extension, which bundles this
grammar (via its `[grammars.marko]` entry pointing here), the language config,
the editor queries, and the
[Marko language server](https://github.com/marko-js/language-server). Install
it from Zed's extension registry, or run `zed: install dev extension` on a
local checkout of that repo. Its `highlights.scm`/`injections.scm` are copies
of the `queries/` here, used as-is: Zed evaluates the
`#eq?`/`#any-of?`/`#not-any-of?` predicates, `injection.combined`, and the
dynamic `@injection.language` dialects. The Zed-specific `brackets.scm` and
`outline.scm` are maintained in that extension repo.

### VS Code

VS Code does not consume tree-sitter grammars. Marko support there remains
the tmLanguage-based
[Marko VS Code extension](https://github.com/marko-js/language-server),
which this grammar's queries are designed to match visually.

## The tree

```marko
div.panel
  <button onClick() { count++ }>${count}</button>
```

```

  (element
    (tag_name (tag_name_fragment))
    (shorthand_class (tag_name_fragment))

A few structural notes:

- `element_end` is a zero-width node marking where an element closes
  implicitly (concise dedent, void tags, self-closing, end of input).
  `concise_open_tag_end` is similarly zero-width (or covers a trailing `;`).
- Delimiters are visible named tokens (`args_open`/`args_close`,
  `params_open`/`params_close`, `type_open`/`type_close`,
  `attr_group_open`/`attr_group_close`, `method_body_open`/
  `method_body_close`, `scriptlet_block_open`/`scriptlet_block_close`,
  `placeholder_start`/`placeholder_end`), so bracket-matching and
  punctuation queries can target them.
- Whitespace is significant in Marko, so the grammar has no `extras`; text
  nodes contain their exact whitespace.
- Shorthands may follow the tag name in any order (`<a#d:b.c>`, carrying
  the `shorthand` field) or any attribute (`<input x=1 #d .c :b>`). The
  attribute-position split is whitespace-based, newlines included:
  `<a x=foo\n  .bar()>` is value `foo` then class `bar`; continue a chain
  without the space or in parentheses (`x=(foo\n  .bar())`).
- A tag variable is not an attribute: in `<a/b :c>` the `:c` is the tag
  variable's type annotation (`var_type`), not a name shorthand.
- Invalid input produces an `ERROR` node from the first error onward,
  matching how Marko itself reports a single error per template rather than
  guessing at recovery.

## Tag types

Tag parsing in Marko depends on the tag. This grammar follows the
[tags API](https://markojs.com/docs/reference/core-tag)'s `parseOptions` (and
the vscode tmLanguage grammar it replaces), which sorts tags into three
groups.

Void tags take no children and no closing tag: the html void elements plus
`const`, `debug`, `id`, `let`, `lifecycle`, `log`, and `return`.

Raw-text tags (`script`, `style`, `html-script`, `html-style`,
`html-comment`) have bodies of text and placeholders only.

Statement tags (`import`, `export`, `static`, `server`, `client`, plus
`class` for class-API compatibility) treat the rest of the line, and any
indented continuation, as a single embedded statement.

## Embedded languages

Marko templates embed TypeScript and CSS throughout, and
`queries/injections.scm` maps it all. TypeScript is injected into every
expression position: placeholders, attribute values/spreads, arguments,
shorthand-method bodies, scriptlets, statement-tag bodies, and the
pattern/default parts of tag variables and parameters.

Statement tags split into two groups, mirroring how the compiler consumes
them. `import`, `export`, and `class` are pass-through TypeScript, where the
keyword is part of the statement, so the whole element (keyword included) is
injected and the keyword takes its color from the TS grammar. For `static`,
`server`, and `client` the keyword is Marko syntax that the compiler strips,
so only the body is injected and `highlights.scm` captures the keyword as
`@keyword` (the tmLanguage grammar makes the same split). `<script>`/
`<html-script>` bodies inject TypeScript and `<style>`/`<html-style>` bodies
inject CSS, including their concise `script --` / `style --` block forms,
with `injection.combined` merging chunks split by placeholders. `style`
dialect shorthands are honored the way the compiler resolves them: the last
shorthand segment names the injected language, so `<style.scss>` and
`style.module.scss --` inject `scss` while plain `<style>` falls back to
`css`. `html-style` is exempt, since its shorthand is a real class attribute,
not a dialect.

Type annotations (tag var/param types, `<T>` type args/params) are captured
as `@type` instead of injected: a bare type is not a valid TypeScript
program, so flat coloring is the accurate option (the tmLanguage grammar
makes the same approximation). One residual case: the parameters of a
shorthand method (`onClick(event) { … }`) inject as a whole TS program,
which renders typed parameters slightly off, since that position cannot be
split without lookahead the scanner doesn't have.

## Fidelity and development

Marko's parser is [htmljs-parser](https://github.com/marko-js/htmljs-parser);
this grammar's external scanner reimplements its state machine, and the test
suite (`npm test`, Node 22) asserts the tree reproduces the parser's event
stream with byte-precise ranges across the parser's full fixture suite, plus
thousands of templates from the Marko ecosystem during development.

The reference parser and its fixtures are always the same htmljs-parser
revision: they are fetched together into `.cache/` with degit, so the suite
compares the grammar against the exact parser the fixtures came from (set
`HTMLJS_FIXTURES` to point at a local checkout's fixtures instead, and the
adjacent sources are used as the parser; if this directory is dropped inside
an htmljs-parser checkout, the local parser sources are used automatically).
The published `htmljs-parser` package is only a last-resort fallback. The
grammar tracks the parser, so the suite is only expected to be green against
the htmljs-parser revision the grammar was synced with.

See `__tests__/` and `tools/` to work on the grammar itself; the scanner
internals are documented at the top of `src/scanner.c`.
