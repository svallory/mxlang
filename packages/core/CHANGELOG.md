### A custom tag's template is a compilation unit (decision 95)

A discovered template tag (`tags/icon.mx`) is no longer expanded into its
caller. It compiles through the same per-file pipeline a page uses, into a
module, and the caller emits an injected `import` plus an ordinary component
call — the shape an explicitly imported tag already produced on all six hosts.

- **breaking:** **a tag's `static` block now runs once per _process_, not once
  per calling module.** Its statements live in the tag's own module and are
  evaluated at import time, which is the module system's rule and Marko's own
  model. This is observable for any tag whose `static` block has side effects
  (a counter, a registration, an allocation): previously each calling module
  re-ran it, and now the first import does. A tag that needs per-call work
  should do it in the template body rather than in `static`.
- **breaking:** a template's `import`s no longer hoist into the caller's
  module, so the "same local name from a different module" error is gone along
  with the merge that raised it.
- **added:** `input` is a real parameter rather than a substituted name. A
  template may read an attribute any number of times (the caller's expression
  is evaluated once, at the call), accept a spread, use `input` as a value, or
  destructure it — every limit the substitution engine carried is gone.
- **added:** a tag file may export anything, and its `export interface Input`
  is now the tag's public type, typing the call site through the import.
- **added:** a tag may call itself; a module importing itself is legal ESM, so
  recursion terminates on the tag's data rather than on a compiler depth cap.
  **Mutual and self cycles between tag templates are now legal** rather than a
  compile error naming the path: two templates that call each other are an
  ordinary module cycle, and the unit mid-compile is recorded as `pending` so
  the metadata lookup terminates. Deliberate — the cycle detector existed only
  because inlining could not terminate.
- **added:** `parseOptions.openTagOnly` with a body is a positioned MX error at
  the call site (`` `<x>`: does not accept content ``) rather than a Marko
  parse error; `<@content>` on a tag call is rejected.
- **added:** compiling a tag unit caches `{ readsContent, attributeTags }`, so
  a body passed to a tag that never reads `input.content` still warns at the
  call site — MX's improvement over Marko, preserved across the rewrite.
- **removed:** the template expansion engine — `input` substitution, hygiene
  renaming, caller-side import/static merging, the expansion depth and node
  caps, and the template cycle detector. A tag being a separate module makes
  each of them unnecessary rather than merely unused.
- **fixed:** a discovered tag whose template contains a `static` block no
  longer crashes the compiler with `unexpected module-level node kind "Static"
  in the body walk`.
