# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Attribute-tag IR v2 support for singular named slots, including mutually
  exclusive `<if>`/`<else if>`/`<else>` branches, the Astro-specialized
  `AttrTag<C>` type, and its automatic `.amx` type import.

### Changed

- Named slots now expose both the callable renderable view and the default
  data view's `.content` thunk to `.mx` components. Arrays, attributes,
  params, and nested attribute tags remain positioned host errors because an
  Astro slot is keyed only by name.
